**Capital Efficiency**: Typically defined as "capital efficiency is the ratio of how much a company is spending on growing revenue and how much they're getting in return." Otherwise known as 'Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)'. However, in crypto, defi, and more specifically, as it relates to liquidity pools and/or AMMs, I would argue that capital efficiency is more accurately defined as:
1. The ratio of how much a person or entity is deploying in liquidity vs. how much return is being generated (very similar to the above definition); 
2. The percentage of capital which is sitting idle in a pool, not providing any liquidity to a trading pair or to the capital markets more broadly due to the fact that no one is trading at the given price.
